# Tubify

![tubify](images/icon-128.png)

Tubify is a chrome extension that saves music from YouTube to Spotify instantly. It has two main features:
- search the current YouTube video title in Spotify, and save the most relevant song track to your Spotify library
- download the current YouTube video in .mp3 format and save it to your local folder, so you can play the song locally on Spotify

## Permissions

Tubify uses the Spotify API to search and save your music automatically, so you must link your account and authorize the app before using.

## License

This project, including the logo, is licensed under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more.

## Contribution

This is my first attempt to create a chrome extension, so if you think it can be further optimized, please feel free to
